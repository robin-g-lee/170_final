## Introduction

With the number of layoffs in the tech industry escalating throughout the United States following a nation-wide increase in interest rates, we have hypothesized that interest rate is definitely a significant factor that noticeably affects the unemployment rate—raising the question, what other circumstances influence employment? Thus, by applying time series analysis, we attempt to answer the following: what are other potential factors that impact the unemployment rate?
In this research assignment, in addition to interest rate, we have picked the monthly supply of new houses as another independent variable. The intuition behind this choice is that we believe when a massive layoff happens—such as the one recently in 2021—people tend to sell their real estate, leading to a significant increase in the housing supply. This is especially true and exemplified during the 2008 Financial Crisis.
As such, we are curious as to whether or not this phenomenon is a common pattern. We have chosen three time series datasets: interest rate, unemployment, and housing supply. Below is a table summarizing the time series datasets we have selected from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). Data coverage includes all major areas of macroeconomic analysis: growth, inflation, employment, interest rates, exchange rates, production and consumption, income and expenditure, savings and investment, and more
